## Real Address Mode
* Only __1MB__ of memory can be addressed.
* From 00000 to FFFFF
* Processor can run only one program at a time
* Application programs can access any memory location

## Protcted Mode

* Processor can run only multiple programs at a time
* Each running program is assigned 4GB of memory.
* Programs can not access eachother's code and data

## virtual - 8086 Mode
Processor creates a virtual 8086 machine with its own 1MB address space

Byte Addressable Memory:

Each byte location(8-bit)has a separate
address.

segment-offset address
16-bit Segment value
16-bit Offset value

E.g.  segment-offset address 08F1:0100

## Program segments
> CODE<br>
> DATA<br>
> STACK <br>


* CS contains the 16-bit code segment address
* DS contains the 16-bit data segment address
* SS contains the 16-bit stack segment address

### 4GB Linear address space
CS references code segment descriptor table
DS references data segment descriptor table
SS references stack segment descriptor table
